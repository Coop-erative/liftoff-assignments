## Submission Instructions

### Overview
I love to cook, and these days I think everyone has to get used to some cooking. Often times we look for recipes online and start a collection of favorites...Or at least the website URLS. Difficult to shop from or choose recipes from that. I believe a website that would allow folks to input thier own recipes and or the URL's of other recipes to fill in thier favorites and have nice output views to show what they like or what grocery shopping would allow for what recipes.
